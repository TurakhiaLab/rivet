RIPPLES Job Orchestrator When running a <code>RIVET</code> job on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), <code>RIVET</code> calculates the number of long branches in the input mutation-annotated tree and partitions them across <code>n</code> GCP instances, which is a parameter specified by the user.  This stage of the pipeline is responsible for setting up and launching these parallel jobs, as well as monitoring their progress as they run. This stage of the pipeline also initiates a Chronumental job, to run concurrently as a subprocess on the local machine, which is explained in the following part B.</p> <p>B. Infer MAT nodes ancestral dates In order to infer the emergence of detected ancestral recombinant nodes of interest for ranking and epidemiological prioritization, <code>RIVET</code> builds a time-tree using the Chronumental method. This method uses the sample dates provided in the sequence metadata file to build a probabilistic model for length of time across branches in the tree and is able to infer the dates of all internal nodes in the tree. <code>RIVET</code> uses these dates for internal nodes that we label as recombinants.</p> <p>C. Mult-node GCP Workflow When running a <code>RIVET</code> job on GCP, the <code>RIPPLES</code> recombinant search and subsequent filtration pipeline utilizes multi-node parallelism. The degree of speedup depends on how many GCP instances the user decides to allocate towards the job, since the <code>MAT</code> long branches to search will be automatically partitioned across the given <code>n</code> machines. On each instance, once a putative list of recombinant nodes is obtained, the pipeline on that machine begins quality control and filtration checks to flag false-positive recombinants. </p> <p>D. Post-filtration Aggegrator and Ranking This is the last stage of the pipeline and it occurs on your local machine, for both on-premise and GCP <code>RIVET</code> workflows. Once the recombination search and filtration steps of the pipeline have concluded on all instances and the local <code>Chronumental</code> job has finished, the filtered recombinant results for each partition of long branches are aggregated locally and the post-filtration stage of the pipeline can begin. During this last step, the final list of recombinants is ranked according to a growth metric and also additional information on each recombinant is gathered, such as clade/lineage information, descendant samples, parsimony scores, quality control/filtration information, and more.

RIPPLES Job Orchestrator When running a <code>RIVET</code> job on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), <code>RIVET</code> calculates the number of long branches in the input mutation-annotated tree and partitions them across <code>n</code> GCP instances, which is a parameter specified by the user.  This stage of the pipeline is responsible for setting up and launching these parallel jobs, as well as monitoring their progress as they run. This stage of the pipeline also initiates a Chronumental job, to run concurrently as a subprocess on the local machine, which is explained in the following part B.</p> <p>B. Infer MAT nodes ancestral dates In order to infer the emergence of detected ancestral recombinant nodes of interest for ranking and epidemiological prioritization, <code>RIVET</code> builds a time-tree using the Chronumental method. This method uses the sample dates provided in the sequence metadata file to build a probabilistic model for length of time across branches in the tree and is able to infer the dates of all internal nodes in the tree. <code>RIVET</code> uses these dates for internal nodes that we label as recombinants.</p> <p>C. Mult-node GCP Workflow When running a <code>RIVET</code> job on GCP, the <code>RIPPLES</code> recombinant search and subsequent filtration pipeline utilizes multi-node parallelism. The degree of speedup depends on how many GCP instances the user decides to allocate towards the job, since the <code>MAT</code> long branches to search will be automatically partitioned across the given <code>n</code> machines. On each instance, once a putative list of recombinant nodes is obtained, the pipeline on that machine begins quality control and filtration checks to flag false-positive recombinants. </p> <p>D. Post-filtration Aggegrator and Ranking This is the last stage of the pipeline and it occurs on your local machine, for both on-premise and GCP <code>RIVET</code> workflows. Once the recombination search and filtration steps of the pipeline have concluded on all instances and the local <code>Chronumental</code> job has finished, the filtered recombinant results for each partition of long branches are aggregated locally and the post-filtration stage of the pipeline can begin. During this last step, the final list of recombinants is ranked according to a growth metric and also additional information on each recombinant is gathered, such as clade/lineage information, descendant samples, parsimony scores, quality control/filtration information, and more.
