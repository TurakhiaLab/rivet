# Welcome to the RIVET Wiki



RIVET is a program designed to aid in SARS-CoV-2 recombination analysis and consists of backend and frontend components:

<br>
1. [Backend](#rivet_backend): RIVET's backend pipeline uses [RIPPLES](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05189-9) for recombination detection in a [mutation-annotated tree](https://usher-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/UShER.html) and has a subsequent automated filtration pipeline to flag potential false-positives resulting from bioinformatic, contamination or other sequencing errors.  Next, the recombination results are ranked and additional results/metadata files are generated by the RIVET backend pipeline that can be loaded by the RIVET frontend.

<br>
2. [Frontend](#rivet_frontend): The RIVET frontend is an interactive, web-browser interface for online visualization, tracking, and analysis of recombination detection results.
